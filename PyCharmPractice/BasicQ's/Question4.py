#You are given two integer variables x and y. You need to perform the following operations:
x,y = 3,4
print(x + y)            #p = x + y : Addition
print(x - y)            #q = x - y : Subtraction
print(x * y)            #r = x * y :Multiplication
print(x / y)            #s = x / y : Division
print(x % y)            #t = x % y : Modulo
